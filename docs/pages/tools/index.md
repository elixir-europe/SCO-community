# Benchmarking analysis tools for single-cell and spatial omics data

As single-cell and spatial technologies continue to advance, an increasing number of analysis tools become available to researchers. Consequently, there is a growing need for datasets and methods that support systematic benchmarking and evaluation of these tools. Validating and benchmarking analysis tools for single-cell measurements is part of the "Eleven grand challenges in single-cell data science" [[*Lähnemann et al. (2020)*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32033589/)].

## Benchmarking infrastructures

### [*Omnibenchmark*](https://omnibenchmark.org/)
Omnibenchmark provides community-driven, extensible and continuously-updating benchmarks. Omnibenchmark defines, runs and versions benchmark execution pipelines by leveraging a formal benchmark specification and a set of (reusable) benchmarking modules. Each benchmarking module implements a data processing step (typically a preprocessing step, method, or metric) and is stored as an independent git repository. Anyone can start (or contribute to) a benchmark. A contribution can be a relevant ground truth dataset, a missing method or metric, or update to existing modules. Omnibenchmark relies on widely used, free and open software solutions, including: git (version control system), GitLab (DevOps), Snakemake (workflow management system), easybuild (reproducible software environments), and apptainer (containerization), among others.

### [*openEbench*](https://openebench.bsc.es/)
OpenEBench is the ELIXIR benchmarking and technical monitoring platform for bioinformatics tools, web servers and workflows.

### [*DANCE*](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-024-03211-z)
DANCE is the first standard, generic, and extensible benchmark platform for accessing and evaluating computational methods across the spectrum of benchmark datasets for numerous single-cell analysis tasks. Currently, DANCE supports 3 modules and 8 popular tasks with 32 state-of-art methods on 21 benchmark datasets. People can easily reproduce the results of supported algorithms across major benchmark datasets via minimal efforts, such as using only one command line. In addition, DANCE provides an ecosystem of deep learning architectures and tools for researchers to facilitate their own model development. DANCE is an open-source Python package that welcomes all kinds of contributions. [*OmicsML/dance GitHub*](https://github.com/OmicsML/dance?tab=readme-ov-file).

### [*IBRAP*](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/24/2/bbad061/7058851)
Integrated Benchmarking scRNA-seq Analytical Pipeline (IBRAP) contains a suite of analytical components that can be interchanged throughout the pipeline alongside multiple benchmarking metrics that enable users to compare results and determine the optimal pipeline combinations for their data.


## Selection of tools for single-cell and spatial omics

### Multimodal omics & spatial integration
[*SpaTrio*](https://github.com/ZJUFanLab/SpaTrio) is a computational tool based on optimal transport that can align single-cell multi-omics data in space while preserving the spatial topology of the tissue section and local geometry of modality ([Yang et al. Cell Genomics 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666979X23002811)).

[*VortRon*](https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/VoltRon) is a spatial omic analysis toolbox for multi-omics integration using spatial image registration. VoltRon is also capable of analyzing multiple types of spatially-aware data modalities.

[*MENDER*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44367-9), Multi-range cEll coNtext DEciphereR, is an unsupervised spatial domain identification tool. MENDER has 3 highlighted points, which are considered major bottlenecks of existing methods:
- multi-slice spatial domain identification that challenges many advanced methods;
- scalability to million-level datasets;
- improved running time efficiency without the need of GPU,

[*yuanzhiyuan/MENDER GitHUb*](https://github.com/yuanzhiyuan/MENDER). 

[*TDEseq*](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-024-03237-3) is a non-parametric statistical method that takes full advantage of smoothing splines basis functions to account for the dependence of multiple time points in scRNA-seq studies, and uses hierarchical structure linear additive mixed models to model the correlated cells within an individual. [*TEDseq GitHub*](https://github.com/fanyue322/TDEseq)

[*scTCP*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38684178/) is a novel semi-supervised deep clustering model for scRNA-seq data. The method utilizes deep clustering in a low-dimensional feature space and incorporates triplet generation based on known labels and pairwise constraints, to guide the clustering process. To address the issue of data imbalance in the dataset, a weighted cross-entropy optimization model was also introduced. [*LF-Yang/Code GitHub*](https://github.com/LF-Yang/Code)

### Generative AI
[*Geneformer*](https://huggingface.co/ctheodoris/Geneformer), pretrained on a large-scale corpus of about 30 million single-cell transcriptomes enables context-specific predictions in settings with limited data in network biology [*Theodoris et al. Nature 2023*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06139-9).

[*scGPT*](https://github.com/bowang-lab/scGPT)  distills critical biological insights concerning genes and cells. scGPT can be optimized to achieve superior performance across tasks such as cell type annotation, multi-batch integration, multi-omic integration, perturbation response prediction and gene network inference [*Cui et al. Nature Methods (2024)*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-024-02201-0).

[*GPTCelltype*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-024-02235-4), is a GPT-4 automated cell type annotation, provided as an open-source software package with a detailed user manual available at [*Winnie09/GPTCelltype github*](https://github.com/Winnie09/GPTCelltype) repository.

[*PERCEPTION*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-024-00756-7), PERsonalized Single-Cell Expression-Based Planning for Treatments In ONcology, is a precision oncology computational pipeline. PERCEPTION uses publicly available matched bulk and single-cell (sc) expression profiles from large-scale cell-line drug screens. These profiles help build treatment response models based on patients’ sc-tumor transcriptomics. PERCEPTION is available at [*ruppinlab/PERCEPTION GithHUb*](https://github.com/ruppinlab/PERCEPTION).

### Innovative clustering approaches
[*scDAC*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38603616/) is deep adaptive clustering method coupling the Autoencoder (AE) and the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM). [*labomics/scDAC GitHub*](https://github.com/labomics/scDAC) 

### Cell type annotation tools

[*popularVote*](https://tabula-sapiens-portal.ds.czbiohub.org/annotateuserdata), i.e. popV, applies a series of annotation algorithms, each providing a different recipe for transferring labels from Tabula Sapiens to the user-provided data. popV then conducts consensus analysis over these algorithms to estimate the most reproducible annotation of every cell, and to highlight cells that are difficult to label.

[*scATOMIC*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37353-8), single cell annotation of tumour microenvironments in pan-cancer settings, is a comprehensive, pan cancer, TME cell type classifier. It is based on a structured scheme that uses hierarchically organized models and elimination processes, reducing the transcriptomic complexity of the TME multi-cellular system to improve cell classification, [*abelson-lab/scATOMIC GitHub*](https://github.com/abelson-lab/scATOMIC).

[*SifiNet*](https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkae307/7655783?login=true) is a robust and accurate computational pipeline for identifying distinct gene sets, extracting and annotating cellular subpopulations, and elucidating intrinsic relationships among these subpopulations. Uniquely, SifiNet bypasses the cell clustering stage, commonly integrated into other cellular annotation pipelines, thereby circumventing potential inaccuracies in clustering that may compromise subsequent analyses [*jichunxie/sifinet GitHub*](https://github.com/jichunxie/sifinet)

### Data imputation
[*scBP*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38706317/) is a two-step graph-based feature propagation method. It initially imputes zero values using non-zero values, ensuring that the imputation process does not affect the non-zero values due to dropout. Subsequently, it denoises the entire dataset by leveraging gene-gene and cell-cell relationships in the respective steps.

## Benchmarking datasets

Benchmarking data can be created in wet lab or in silico by simulators. In this section we present some wet lab experiments and introduce some simulators.

### Simulators for creating benchmarking data
Despite the fact that simulators have several limitations, there has been a significant effort in the past few years to enhance their power, as noted by [*Cao et al. (2021)*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34824223/). The scDesign3, a simulator by [*Song et al. (2023)*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37169966/), appears to be a versatile tool that is capable of overcoming some of the limitations of other existing simulators, according to the developers. [*GRouNdGAN*](https://emad-combine-lab.github.io/GRouNdGAN/), GRN-guided in silico simulation of single-cell RNA-seq data using causal generative adversarial networks, is a causal implicit generative model for reference-based GRN-guided simulation of scRNA-seq [[*Zinati et al. 2024*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48516-6)]

### Wet lab experiments

Over the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the number of published single-cell omics studies, which serve as valuable resources for benchmark experiments. In particular, [*Svensson et al. (2020)*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7698659/) have compiled a comprehensive collection of single-cell omics datasets with manually curated metadata. As part of the implementation study of the ELIXIR Single-Cell Omics Community, we created a series of datasets specifically designed for benchmarking computational tools that focus on single-cell tumor heterogeneity.


#### Benchmark experiments addressing tumor heterogeneity

[*Tumor heterogeneity*](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/tumor-heterogeneity), where distinct cancer cells exhibit diverse morphological and phenotypic profiles, including gene expression, metabolism, and proliferation, poses challenges for molecular prognostic markers and patient classification for targeted therapies. Various omics technologies, such as bulk [[*Babu & Snyder (2023)*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37119971/)] and single-cell omics [[*Flynn et al. (2023)*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37159875/)] approaches, have enabled the characterization of diverse molecular layers at an unprecedented scale and resolution, offering a comprehensive perspective on the behavior of tumors. The integration of multiple omics datasets enables systematic exploration of diverse molecular information [[*Yue et al. (2023)*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36723121/)] at each biological layer, but also presents challenges in extracting meaningful insights from the exponentially growing volume of multi-omics data. To address this challenge, efficient algorithms are required to dig into the data and reveal the underlying complexities of cancer's intricate biological processes. The past few years have seen a proliferation of new computational methods for analyzing single-cell omics data, which can make it challenging to select the most appropriate tool for a particular task.  As a result, it is crucial to establish benchmarking platforms [[*Mangul et al. (2019)*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09406-4), [*Decamps et al. (2021)*](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-021-04381-4), [OpenEBench](https://openebench.bsc.es/), [Omnibenchmark](https://omnibenchmark.pages.uzh.ch/omb-site/), [*Knight et al. (2023)*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36847692/)] and datasets [[*Tian et al. (2018)*](https://www.refine.bio/experiments/SRP155039/designing-a-single-cell-rna-sequencing-benchmark-dataset-to-compare-protocols-and-analysis-methods-rnamix-sort-seq), [Refine.bio](https://www.refine.bio/)] in order to create a controlled environment for the validation of bioinformatics tools in the field of single-cell omics analysis.

##### Healthy and diseases published single cell datasets

[*CELLxGENE*](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/datasets) is a suite of tools that help scientists to find, download, explore, analyze, annotate, and publish single cell datasets. it is characterised by the possibility to download a wide set of published single cell experiments as h5 or seurat (v3) format. 

[*CellCommuNet*](http://www.inbirg.com/cellcommunet/) is an atlas of cell–cell communication networks from single-cell RNA sequencing data of human and mouse tissues in normal and disease states [[*Ma et al. NAR 2024*](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/D1/D597/7321072)].

##### Tian et al. (2019) dataset
As part of [*their article*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31133762/) they created ‘pseudo cells’ from up to five distinct human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. GEO dataset [GSM3618014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM3618014)] contains the mixture of five cell lines: 

- H2228 (PTPN3 KO [[*Jung et al (2012)*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22334442/)], EML4-ALK Fusion [[*Isozaki et al (2015)*]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26719536/))
- H1975 (EGFR L858R and T790M mutations [[*Zhao et al. 2015*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25483995/)])
- A549 (KRAS p.G12S, growth and proliferation [[*Yoon et al. (2010)*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20358631/)]
- H838 (KRASp.G12D [[[*Wang et al. (2019)*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31484165/)])
- HCC827 (EGFR L858R mutation [[*Juchum et al. (2015)*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/hcc827-cell-line)])

Data were generated using 10XGenomics v2 chemistry.
The raw count table was provided without the association of the cell lines to each cell. We have assigned the cell line name to each cell via the similarity between single cell clusters and cell lines bulk data from CCLE database. The annotated count table and the full procedure used for the annotation are present a figshare dataset [[doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23274413.v1](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23274413.v1)]

##### PC9 dataset
In GEO NCBI repository are available single cell data on PC9 untreated lung cancer cell line done in two different labs, using both 10XGenomics and Drop-seq platforms and produced from in vitro culture or xenograph experiments.

- set1: GSM3972657 PC9 in vitro dropseq Chicago (2500 cells)
- set2: GSM4494347 PC9 in vitro dropseq Chicago (12000 cells)
- set3: GSM3972651 PC9 in vitro 10XGenomics Chicago (12649 cells) 
- set4: GSM6106787 PC9 in vitro 10XGenomics Berkeley (413 cells)
- set5: GSM4869650 PC9 xenograft dropseq Chicago (29983 cells)

- set7: BE1 (see below) GSE243665 PC9 in vitro 10XGenomics Turin (4492 cells)

These datasets, because of their differences, i.e. platforms, growth, labs, represent an ideal instrument to benchmark batch removal methods as well as integration methods. The seven sets are available as datasets with the same gene annotation (ensemblID:Symbol). Each set has the cellID with the extension _s(1:5) and set6 has two extensions _s6PC9 and _s6U937. These datasets and the script used for annotation are available as figshare repository ([*10.6084/m9.figshare.23626407*](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PC9_cell_line_scRNAseq_datasets/23626407)). 

##### 77 annotated scRNAseq tumor datasets
Gavish and collaborators [[*Nature 2023*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37258682/)] have recenty curated, annotated and integrated the data from 77 different single cell transcriptomics studies encompassing a total of 1,163 tumour samples covering 24 tumour types and more than 23 milions cells. The data are accessible at [**3CA site**](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/sites/3CA/).

##### SCONE datasets

###### BE2

The cell lines from for BE1 will be used to generate surrogate tumor-tissues for spatial transcriptomics, by embedding in matrigel pools of the 7 cell lines at different ratios. For each cell ratio we will generate a slide (2 sections) using Visium for FFPE samples and  six slides using [*Curio Bioscience*](https://curiobioscience.com/product/) spatial platform for OTC fresh frozen samples. 
In total we expect produce three cell lines ratios:
  
- Cell line 1 40%, cell line 2 25% cell line 3 20%, cell line 4 5%, PBMC 10%
- Cell line 1 45% cell line 2 25%, cell line 3 10%, cell line 4 10%, cell line 5 5%, PBMC 5%
- Cell line 1 25%, cell line 2 25% cell line 3 10% cell line 4 10%, cell line 4 10%, cell line 5 5%, cell line 6 5%, cell line 7 5%, PBMC 5%.

###### BE3

PC9 and DV90 cell lines will be used to generate combined scRNAseq and scATACseq experiment using [*10X genomics technology for multi-omics*](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/single-cell-multiome-atac-plus-gene-expression). Specifically we will generate three experiments: i) PC9 alone, ii) DV90 alone, iii) PC9/DV90 co-colture (two replicates).  PC9 alone, DV90 alone and PC9/DV90 co-colture will also be analysed in triplicates the secreted microvesicles (RNA/miRNAseq) and the bulk intracellular RNA/miRNAseq. The idea is to provide a comprehesive data set to benchmark tools devoted to the prediction of cell to cell crosstalk ([*Xie et al. 2023*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10452151/), [*Zhang et al. 2023*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37735248/)).
