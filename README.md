# ELIXIR Single-Cell Omics Community

Welcome to our Single-Cell Omics (SCO) Community's GitHub repository! Here, we organise and orchestrate information about single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to help researchers using these technologies. Below you can find some quick links to the different parts of the repository where you can add events or curate lists of SCO related tools, training materials, dataset and standards.

## News and Upcoming Events

You can list News and Upcoming events to the this file: [`/docs/pages/news/new_and_events.csv`](/docs/pages/news/new_and_events.csv). There, you should simply add a new line and fill the information for all columns.

If you would like to create an SCO Community event, you need to do these steps:
  1. Create a markdown file in this folder: [`/docs/pages/news/events`](/docs/pages/news/events). Please use this naming convention: "YYYYMMDD_Event_Title.md", where "YYYY-MM-DD" is the 1st day of the event incase of multiple days.
  2. Then, in this markdown, you can use [`20230321_SCO_trainer_workshop.md`](/docs/pages/news/events/20230321_SCO_trainer_workshop.md) event as a template as inspiration. In your event, you should add the relevant sections, i.e.:
    - Brief introduction (please polish to maximum 100 words)
    - Dates and city/country
    - Venue details, including Travel information and Accommodation
    - Online Attendance options
    - Participating institution logos/names
    - Footnotes/References.
  3. With your Markdown description set, you can add the summary information to the `/docs/news/new_and_events.csv` file.
